# Brain Tumor Segmentation Using LadderNet in MRI Images

A deep learning-based segmentation model that leverages the LadderNet architecture to identify and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Overview

This project applies the LadderNet model for accurate brain tumor segmentation using MRI images. The model addresses common challenges in medical imaging like precise tumor localization, limited dataset sizes, and the need for multi-path information flow.

## Motivation

Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional models struggle with segmentation precision and capturing multiscale contextual information. LadderNet, with its multi-U-Net structure and extensive skip connections, offers a robust solution.
