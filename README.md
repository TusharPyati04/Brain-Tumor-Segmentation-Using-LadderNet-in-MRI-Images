# Brain Tumor Segmentation Using LadderNet in MRI Images

A deep learning-based segmentation model that leverages the LadderNet architecture to identify and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

## Overview

This project applies the LadderNet model for accurate brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. LadderNet builds upon the U-Net architecture by introducing multiple encoder-decoder paths and extensive skip connections, enabling better feature extraction and improved segmentation accuracy. It effectively handles challenges like limited medical data, poor tumor localization, and variability in tumor appearance. Trained on a labeled Kaggle dataset, the model achieves strong results with a mean accuracy of 90.82% and a ROC AUC of 95.04%, making it suitable for real-world medical image analysis.
